      Formerly knows as CBTC, NECBDC was incorporated with the objective of
      organizing the hitherto untapped bamboo sector of NE India which is a
      significant occupant of its topography, culture and customary practices
      since time immemorial. NECBDC involves its creativity and resource in
      talent scouting, training, technology sourcing, market linkage for giving
      a new age thrust to the age old bamboo sector. Keeping in mind the fast
      track changes in the global marketplace, contemporizing the traditional
      presentational aesthetics of bamboo end products receives our priority. In
      this never ending endeavor of NECBDC to unleash a new dimension to bamboo
      of North East, we have set a benchmark to measure our impact. Unfailingly
      the apex index of our benchmark is: how many more homes did we add today
      to the bamboo grove of happiness and prosperity!
